# Tuple Out Dice Game

## Overview
In the Tuple Out dice game, players take turns rolling three dice. The main goal of the game is to get the highest combined total in three dice rolls without rolling three of the same number (tupling out). Players can re roll any dice that do not tuple out anytime during their turn to get the highest score.

### Game Rules:
- Players roll three dice each turn.
- If all three dice show the same number, the player "tuples out" and scores 0 points for the turn.
- If two dice show the same number, they are "fixed" and cannot be re-rolled.
- The player can re-roll the remaining dice, or choose to stop the turn and add up the points.
- The game continues until a player reaches 50 points, or until all players have rolled in five rounds. 
  
### Game Over Condition:
- The game ends after five rounds and/or if a player rolls and earns 50 points. 

### High Score:
- After each game, the highest score across all players is tracked.
- The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins and their score is displayed at the end of the game.
